review,rating
this is the best anti acne solution there is reading most of the other reviews i can see people are not using it correctly a dermatologist in scotland put me on to this drug num mg g num mg g gel and explained it is to be used sparingly i e do not rub it all over your face or it will not only burn and dry your skin which in turn will cause your sebacious glands to activate to moisturise your skin which can lead to get more acne infection but also make your system more resistant to the drug important apply to each pimple individual and slightly around the area not all over your face or back i have since been given another tube of drug in romania that is weaker num mg g num mg g and found this still works might be better for some,2
i have never felt a pain like i did upon the drug insertion it was a num step process and the second step was the most painful they say it is different for everyone apparently my pain threshold is much lower than other women this sharp pain and cramping cause immediate tears and a small yelp immediately after i became very pale and lightheaded and had to use the restroom i could hardly sit up in the bathroom because i was so lightheaded and nausea caused me to vomit i was so weak and honestly wanted to just lie on the floor because i began to sweat after about num minutes i was able to stand up and drive home the cramps and nausea remained very severe until the next morning drug and heating pads helped me sleep that night,2
i had this inserted today due to extremely heavy bleeding during my periods i chose to get an iud the previous reviews freaked me out the insertion hurt for about num seconds and then i just felt cramps a bit heavier than my period it was not as bad as some of these reviews stated maybe a num num i was told to expect moderate cramping for about num days as my body adjusts and light bleeding for num num months hoping this will be worth it,2
when i say i have never ever taken applied any medication to my cold sores before that is as effective as drug i mean it i have been dealing with this virus forever and i have tried everything my doctor gave me a prescription to have on hand and num weeks ago as i was afraid to ask for it at the pharmacy num days ago though when i woke up with that infamous tingle i ran and filled it up i messed up the dosage but once i caught up it really began to disappear by mid num nd day it was practically flat and i typically swell badly its day num and im back to normal thank god for drug try it,2
i have tried heat pads freeze pads gels tablets and i am really pleased i saw these advertised on the tv i tried them and i had no expectations at all i was very surprised that they worked on my neck pain my hip pain back pain and have no complaints worth giving a go may not be suitable for everyone but worked for me,2
as i lay here weighing the benefits of clawing the inside of my own vagina vs continuing to let the medicine take effect i wish more than anything i never inserted this devil cream inside my body in the first place this is night one for me and im just going to tough out the yi and not use it again ever i cant do another night of this the mild itching i had before is nothing compared to the itching i have now if there were sandpaper near me i would use it repeatedly inside and out i can feel my heart beating in my vagina thats the pain im feeling,0
dont know,0
these took almost twenty four hours to work i decided to take two at num num am rather than before bed as i had read drinking lots and eating helps to reduce the stomach cramps after reading other horror stories of nausea projectile vomiting and cramps worse than giving birth i braced myself no need really at all yes i felt a little sick and my stomach became bloated throughout the day went to bed terrified i was going to wake up in crippling agony nothing woke up the following morning and at num am my stomach felt like washing machine what followed was diarrhoea on and off all morning but not the i cant cope shoot me now kind it didnt hurt and i have not had one cramp sweat or feeling of faintness,2
after num days of taking drug my chlamydia infection went away i had awful side effects from drug though and i am still having them num days after my final dose,2
just an fyi to all on this medication diarrhea is the way you body gets rid of toxins that is how you know your drug os working the side effects of nausea and heartburn can be mangable but diarrhea is actually a good sign that the end is near and you will be feeling better if it gets to be too much and you are dehydrated then you should think about stopping the medication i would recommend this medication to help with all indicated infections,2
works well for me with regular use,2
i am a num yr old female i have had acne since i was num i noticed bumps all over my forehead for years along with a large cystic pimple a couple times a year num weeks ago my dermatologist prescribed drug along with num drug num oral num topical drug and drug this has been the perfect trifecta of treatment my forehead has not been this clear since i was a a kid and my skin is significantly less greasy highly recommend,2
id been on the drug pill for many years without problem this year my insurance changed and the pharmacy issued drug in its place i thought itd be fine since it has the the exact same amount of drug wow was i wrong luckily i only got a three month supply because i am quitting this pill in two and half months on this pill ive had a period or bleeding every num num days its not just bleeding i get the whole deal cramps lower back pain hunger cravings crankiness and bloating my skin has broken out ive been super irritable moody and i dont understand how the side effects can be so extreme for me when i previously was on drug for so long and experienced none of these things,0
it stopped my cough but i had severe diarrhea i figured it out after it happened to me twice,0
i started taking bc pills when i was num yrs old began using drug when i was maybe num or num either way im num now and am happy with my body and its cycle i get my period usually on time every num weeks num days i do cramp but lighter than off oc i have never been pregnant to my knowledge and i wouldnt say im remotely good with taking it on time or every day drug is very reliable in my opinion i would recommend it to someone interested or looking at bc,2
im allergic to drug drug and several other pain medications i took drug for severe neck and shoulder pain it worked i had a little upset stomach but took an antacid and it went away it worked better for me because of me being allergic to other pain medications it also worked wonders after surgery it should not be taken for more than num days and use caution if you have kidney or liver disease use caution if you are using a blood thinner it also did not make we drowsy fast heart rate or dizzy,2
the packaging is horrible take a page from drug and work on the delivery,0
it has been decent i have definitely seen a cut back in my oil production and acne on my neck however i have been getting breakouts on my cheeks and forehead and i never really did before i dont see much of a difference other than less oil my acne location just pretty much relocated,1
i started this birth control num months ago right before i left for college in august i read reviews and i was iffy but my drug promised me everyones body is different and i should try it out the first month was okay i was happy as ever at college i got horrible cramps when i got my first period on it and my period was really irregular but i figured i just needed to adjust come late october november and now december have been the worst months of my life im crying every day lost my boyfriend planned on started therapy dont want to go back to school nothing makes me happy i want to do nothing at all times everybodys body is different but this depression isnt even worth risking do not take,0
i have had some side effects really heavy periods and about two days after i take it out i have extreme hot flashes that make me extremely warm i was out on a very cold day when this last happened my head was just about soaked with sweat,2
im so glad i finally read reviews about this pill and people are not lying when they say its the worst i recently found out that i have vertigo but i was dealing with what i thought were vertigo symptoms for much longer than my doctor said they would last the symptoms of this pill and vertigo are extremely similar i am constantly light headed almost everyday sometimes to the point where i cant even drive it makes me nauseous i cant focus at work and if you think people who said if gives them mood swings were being dramatic theyre not i have anxiety attacks on a regular basis ive most definitely gained weight and have seen my acne get worse dont take this pill,0
my pulmonary function tests were the best they have been in num years since i switched from drug drug to drug i feel so much better,2
all my life a typical night would start with num to num hours laying in bed before falling asleep and then waking several times with trouble getting back to sleep my bedroom has light blocking curtains plus a white noise machine but i still had trouble getting more than five hours of sleep my doctor has prescribed drug drug drug drug drug and trazadone i have tried drug and drug drug pills but nothing worked well or long term until i tried drug i take num mg num minutes before bedtime and i sleep a good num to num hours daily i have more vivid dreams but no nightmares and num years with no loss of effectiveness and no weight gain a good dose of morning drug and i have no lingering grogginess either,2
drug has literally saved my life not once but twice the first was after the birth of my son i was on num mg i was struggling with obsessive compulsive disorder depression and severe anxiety drug along with therapy made it able for me to live a normal life for almost num years i just recently had a horrible bought with anxiety i am finally coming out of that nightmare i had a lot of life stressors that brought on the anxiety and caused the break as much as i tried i couldnt come out of it so my dr increased my dose to num mg i have been on the num mg for exactly a week today and i am so excited and cautious to say when i woke up this morning my heart wasnt beating out of my chest and i have been able to enjoy my day,2
i have only been on drug for about num month and i just started my second week of my second month i guess i didnt notice earlier but i started to get slight headaches and i didnt feel very well physically and mentally it do help with my cramps and my period not so much my acne but its better the worst part of drug has to be the mood swings and the sweating i sweat a lot even if its cold ill start a light sweat its gross but the mood swings are the worst i just started feeling this and it happened while i was talking to one of my friends i just blew up on him for no reason then later on i started to feel really badmentally and i cried for a while and i couldnt figure out why i was crying i dont recommend,0
the drug cleared up the white spots in my mouth within num days and my throat was less sore so that i could start eating solid food for the first time since radiation treatment num weeks on the third bottle but have not fully cleared all the thrush from my throat i have had chemo radiation and heaps of drug so i am a hard case for it,2
caused me to do things and not remember afterwards i would be cautious while first taking this medication,0
i have never been so upset embarrassed with outbursts of anger the day before i was screaming at my daughter at a water park as well as my poor son in the airport i cant believe my aggressive behavior im getting off of this,0
well i am using num mg per day together with rexetin drug and fluonxol sometimes drug i used to have much more medicine because i have manic depression with tendency to self harm and sleep disorder what i like about this medicine is that i can have kind of num d dreams and i can sleep normally but what i dislike is that i have low libido and thats why my boyfriend thinks that something is wrong with him even when i say that it is just a side effect of medicines i have to take it just seems for me like must to do action without any passion and it is strange because i was very different before with great sex drive,2
i had unprotected sex the day before i started ovulating and took the morning after pill num hours after the sex an hour after taking the pill i had cramps bleeding and felt really tired the next week i had breast tenderness and sometimes what felt like cramps my advice is to take it asap to not panic and dont read plan b horror stories go into planned parenthood and talk to someone if you need a peace of mind or you can chat with someone online i did and it helped me a lot i got my period two days early and it was slightly heavier than normal try to relax and let the pill do what it does and take it day by day its going to okay whatever happens its going to be okay,2
diarrhea a side effect,1
i havent been on it for a long time and i have suffered from severe nausea and have thrown up twice my appetite has lessened even more so than it was before my acne has gone down and my boobs have grown a lot although i have thrown up if its for acne i would suggest it,2
i have sleep apnea but cant stand a mask on me and without drugs i wake up constantly by stopping to breath i take num mg of diph an hour before i want to go to sleep have a couple puffs of indica night time pot its legal here and it works like a charm i stay asleep for num or num hrs which is a long time for me little groggy when i wake up but it goes away after a couple puffs of sativa day time pot ive been a toker for num yrs its good for a lot of uses i am num my doctor says he agrees that pot is easier on the body and mind than prescription drugs for anxiety insomnia depression painand loss of appetite they make edibles gum etc for those that hate smoke,2

at first i really liked drug its super easy to use and its nice to be able to forget about it for num weeks i could feel it every now and then but it wasnt uncomfortable just there after one month i ended up with the worst acne on my back and chest that i have ever had in my life the acne was so bad i almost thought it was a reaction i took drug out and within a week my skin was clear again i didnt have any other side effects besides the acne but acne isnt something i can deal with im switching back to pills,2
took this for the first time today for a migraine and it made me sooo sick to my stomach severe nausea and crampy stomach pain will not take this again,0
after suffering years of migraines and using imigran which did not work for me finally decided to use the nasal spray for migraines really works well when it wants to but sometimes if the migraine is really bad it wont do anything i get bad side effects such as a swollen tounge and really sore and sensitive mouth but would rather that than a migraine so is good overall,2
i started this pill a couple months before turning num just turned num so about num years or so i did notice the weight gain but i quit smoking at the same time so i dont really know what caused it my periods dont exist anymore my doctor told me i can skip my placebos and never bleed i still spot at random times of the year usually twice a year and its very light to where i dont have to wear anything i have noticed my mood swings getting pretty bad at certain times but overall the pill works great for me i havent had any issues yet,2
ive only been taking it for num days ive had no side effects except im always thirsty but i see that as a positive because it forces me to drink water all day long i do get a little hungry at meal times but i get full so fast after eating a very small amount of food i make a green smoothie for breakfast and i am totally fine until lunch yesterday i had a yogurt and some honeydew melon i work out most days at num pm so i ate a snack of a cheese stick and a couple pieces of turkey before and then after all i had was a couple more pieces of turkey was not hungry i usually snack a lot more and eat much bigger meals i have not weighed myself yet im waiting till saturday num week i am num and weighed num last saturday,2

this medication gave me the worst experience of my life it made me sleepy yes but at the same time it sped up my mental discomfort and it made my muscles jump similar to restless leg syndrome but throughout my entire body it was so bad they had to reverse it with drug to alleviate the symptoms and finally they gave me a mixture of drug and drug to put me in a twilight state until it passed if you have any medication allergies even mild i would strongly advise against this medication,0

i started drug today at only num num mg i felt so undeniably and utterly unwell that i cannot imagine even trying it for a second day in summary severe low blood sugar symptoms ravenously hungry and i was also prescribe this for weight loss as well as diabetes headache no energy and a general feeling of being very not well in short i do not recommend this to anyone,0
my doctor gave me num weeks of drug num mg as a sample to take in addition to my num mg of drug made me extremely dizzy and had difficulty driving safely due to this,0
after num years of untreated depression anxiety and panic attacks i decided to finally ask for help that came in the form of num mg drug for the first week num mg for another month and boosted up to num mg for the next few months in that time i had nothing but bad side effects instead of feeling depressed and sad i just got grumpy and mad i had trouble with my sex drive performance and the insomnia was ridiculous my partner told me i had changed since starting the medication i have since come off all medication and living happily without,0
i had a severe skin infection and i used this medication and i had no issues i was told not to overdose by taking the medicine to close together but altogether a positive experience very pricey though thats the only downfall,2
the reason im giving it a num instead of num is because of its side effects otherwise this patch works really well for an overnight or two day fishing trip at least in my experience i thought im getting cold and feeling sick after i get off the fishing boat because my throat was getting dry and dryer and dryer at that time im not aware that one of its side effects was dry mouth throat aside from that i didnt feel anything anymore after couple of days ill use it again for my next fishing trip ill opt for a dry throat verses getting sick on the boat,2
it works well for tsh supression,2
drug is amazing i tried all sorts of acne creams and this one is like a blessing i went to my dermatologist and she gave this for me to use this is my second week and most of my pimples have eased and are gone im impressed with this product and i will keep using it,2
youre supposed to inject this under skin not in the muscle i have transverse mylytis and was just diagnosed w relapsing ms been getting shots but for some reason they stopped today and its only been num days,0
i have read so many things and do not know what to believe i have post traumatic stress disorder and have taken sleep aides from the health food store which left me with vertigo and not feeling well i have not had any of the usual side effects with drug and it leaves me refreshed however i do have one weird side effect and i was not sure at first if it was the drug but it is i am usually a person who is cold and likes the heat but i have gotten heat sick several times and living in nyc where there is no air and we are constantly having heat waves it has made me sensitive to heat i am super sensitive and usually if there is a side effect to be had i get it but really i have not had anything except the heat exhaustion i mean sweating etc,2
two years ago i couldnt sleep my doctor gave me all type of sleep meds nothing worked the only med works is this i take num mg every night on and off for num years no side effect,2
i am currently taking drug and i just got a face peel a week ago a few days after my face peel my face still wasnt improving very well i started using my drug cream and my face is almost completely clear it has made my face dry and it burns pretty bad but with lotion it isnt bad at all i am very impressed i am sure that the medication and the face peel has both made an impact on my face but the drug is helping a lot i was skeptical of using this product since i have read that the acne will get worse before it gets better that has not happened to me,2
it seems to work for generalized anxiety when taken in large doses twice a day for me anyway it does seem to cause weight gain though,2
i starting taking drug num weeks ago i was extremely stressed out and was suffering from ptsd due to a bad car accident after about num num num wks i really noticed a difference not stressed anymore but i do feel a bit zombie like i also have a problem with memory and focusing also really tired at night overall right now i guess it is worth the trade off also have intestinal issues but hope it will go away,2
it works fine i eat first then take the pill with num num mins gone doesnt make you sleepy,2
i was on this birth control for about num months straight and i went off now i am currently back on and i absolutely love it no weight gain no acne lighter shorter periods the only thing is when i first started taking it i spotted for a month which is normal other than that i love it,2
i have currently started taking drug for the last week and a half i have experienced numbness and tingling throughout my whole body along with what feels like electrical impulse shocks im tired all the time trouble sleeping i can only hope that these side effects will cease because the side effects are making me feel really bad just the same way as i did with drug i was taking,1
